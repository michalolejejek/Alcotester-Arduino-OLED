# Alcotester-Arduino-OLED
A quite usefull arduino breathanalyzer

Do make this project you will need:
- Arduino board (Uno/nano/mega it dosen't matter)
- MQ-3 alcohol gas sensor 
- OLED dispalay 128x64 with Adafruit libraries
- You can also use led and buzzer

Don't use it as real breathanalyzer it is kind of toy and it can show you wrong values 

Don't suggest yourself that you can driving or no! 

Never drive after drinking!
